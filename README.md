# ID-ASG1
# My Portfolio Website
This project is for [ID] Interactive Development ASG1. The website made using this project will be used as a personal online portfolio for others to view.



# Design Process
This website is mainly for future employers, to view my expertises as well as past projects experience. This project will help me consolidate and organise all these details into one website for them to view easily.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
As a future employer, I want to be able to view all relevant information (about someone) easily, so that I can evaluate whether to hire them.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

# Features

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

# Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea
# Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

This website uses CSS as well as HTML for the programming.
Testing was used via Visual Studio Code
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

# Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Form cannot be completed by leaving it blank.

Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
